Stuarz? only a little thing you need to know about it, since it was an app with a lot of lackness, this mean not every feature on the app will be working properly like you ever imagined, and not every data you wish to wanted, it may not be here.

Like wise, I hope you used this app wisely and how the app should be work, and not how the app shouldnt be work.

This app doesn't work like you wish just because you wished for it, and not would be work like you wish just because you operate it.

Nothing will be more useful than attendance system and grading system, even tho I do not understand how the grading system should work, I make it with all my heart and my experience

Should you be worry worried about your data? I don't know? It's yours? what is my problem? I just a programmer, not a stalker, so fuck your data by yourself

Any other question?

Maybe not
